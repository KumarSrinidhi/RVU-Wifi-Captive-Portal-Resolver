# Contributing to RVU-Wifi-Captive-Portal-Resolver 🤝🔒

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! 🚀 This project is specifically designed for users connected to RV University’s Wi-Fi network. As a result, I expect contributors to be affiliated with RV University 🎓, as it will be easier for them to understand the problem and gain access to the captive portal for testing purposes. 🌐

Due to the sensitive nature of the captive portal and its associated infrastructure, I am unable to share all the details with individuals who are not part of RV University. 🔒 To ensure effective contributions, it is important that you have access to the network and are familiar with the challenges the project aims to solve. 

⚠️ Please note that this project is a **basic version**, built out of curiosity, and serves as a starting point for automating the login process for the RV University captive portal. It may not be fully optimized yet, but contributions to improve it are more than welcome! 🙌

If you are part of RV University and would like to contribute, feel free to submit issues 🐞, pull requests 📥, or reach out for further clarification on how you can assist!

Thank you for your understanding and support! 💡🙏
